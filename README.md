Score Prediction ML Application
Overview
This repository contains the code for an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts scores based on given data. The application is deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and leverages AWS CodePipeline for a seamless CI/CD experience.

Architecture
Machine Learning Model: [Description of the model, e.g., a regression model built using TensorFlow/PyTorch, etc.]
AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Used for deploying the web application.
AWS CodePipeline: Automates the build, test, and deploy phases whenever there's a change to the repository.
Features
Real-time Predictions: Users can obtain score predictions in real-time by inputting relevant data into the application.
Scalability: Thanks to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, the application can automatically scale based on traffic.
Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment: Any changes to the repository trigger an automated pipeline ensuring that the latest version is always available for users.
Prerequisites
AWS account
AWS CLI configured
[Any other software/tool/library needed to run your code]
